# COSI-Electronics

This is a great place to start making your documentation!

You should link to a couple of pages:

* [.](testpage1.md){step}
* [.](testpage2.md){step}

* [.](COSI Electronics - Assembly instruction.md){step}

And you should definitely let people know about the [bill of materials]{BOM} page.


Comments
Here we are collecting a list of issues and improvements. If you found any errors in the documentation, have ideas/suggestions for improvements or if you did some modifications, please let us know (you can edit this document with the tracking function and send it to us).

Known issues
•	software bug in the CPLD code → status LED is still on after the motor power has been switched off
•	PCB design file needs bigger holes for the relay (initial KiCAD file looks good but the conversion to Gerber somehow creates this error)

Improvements
•	A fuse might be added to the power socket
•	small sockets and connectors might be added directly after the steppers/limit switches (→ easy exchange of components)
